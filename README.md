# iOS-Aesthetic
Apple UI Clone is a front-end development project that replicates the sleek, modern, and intuitive design of Apple’s official website. The goal of this project is to emulate Apple's user interface and user experience (UI/UX) principles using modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project captures the essence of Apple’s aesthetic with its minimalistic design, clean typography, and structured layout.
Technologies Used:
HTML5 and CSS3 for a responsive and elegant layout.
Font Awesome for icons and visual enhancements.
Google Fonts (Roboto) for modern typography.
Basic JavaScript for interactive elements (can be expanded with more complex functionality).
